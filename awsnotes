# AWS Notes 
## Why go with a Cloud Provider over On-Premise 
1.  **Trade capital expense for variable.** With on premise you have up front costs which includes data centers and servers. With a Cloud Provider you would only pay for what you use. These services can be turned off at any time. 
2. There is a huge benefit from massive economies of scale. When you are using cloud computing you are sharing the cost with hundreds of other customers which helps you save alot of money 
3. **With cloud computer you can stop guessing capacities.** With on premises, you would buy their own servers, having to guess how much you needs and more often or not paying a lot more extra during down hours. With cloud computing you can eliminate the guesswork about infrastructure capacity needs. **Instead of paying for idle or underutilized servers**, you can scale up or down to meet the current need. 
4. With cloud computing, **you can launch resources within seconds or minutes**  instead of waiting days or weeks for your IT department to implement the solution on-premise. 
5. **Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers**. Focus on the customers, rather than on the heavy lifting of racking,stacking, and powering servers. 
6. With cloud computing you can have your company go global in minutes. **You can deploy your application in multiple regions around the world with a few clicks.** You can provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at a minimal cost. 

## Types of Cloud computing 
Saas or better known as Software as a Service is a completed product that is run and managed by a service provider. **Dont worry about how the service is maintained, It just works and remains readily available** 
 
 Paas also known as Platform as a Service is a service removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure. Therefore you can focus solely on the deployment and management of your application. 
 **Dont worry about provisioning, configuring, or understanding the hardware or OS.** 
  
 IaaS  or infrastructure as a Service is a wait for admins to access the underlying features, computers and other components inside their mainframe. **Dont worry about IT staff, data centers, and hardware.** 
  
 ## What is cloud computing? 
 Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. 
You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping you lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as your business needs change. 

With that said there are 3 types of cloud deployment models, each with their own use.
